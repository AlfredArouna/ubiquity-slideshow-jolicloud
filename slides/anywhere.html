	<li>You can install Jolicloud on as many devices as you’d like and they will always be automatically synchronized. Any app you download, delete, or move around will be the same on all your other machines with no extra work on your part.</li>
	<li>You can even manage your interface from the Cloud - if you’re not on your machine, log in to my.jolicloud.com on any HTML5 browser like Chrome to add, remove, or organize apps.</li>
