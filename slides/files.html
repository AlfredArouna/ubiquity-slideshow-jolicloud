<div class="main">

<div class="content"><ul>
	<!-- Beware the size limit; the text here just about hits the limits. -->
	<li>If you're like most people, your files are probably spread all over the place: at home, at work, on your mobile device or on the Web. It's a headache to remember where everything is saved.</li>
	<li>That's why Joli OS connects all your computer files and your Web files, so you can access everything in one place so you'll never forget. Now you can manage your online files side-by-side with all the other files on your hard drive. </li>
</ul></div>
